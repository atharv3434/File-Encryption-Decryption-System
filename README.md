# File-Encryption-Decryption-System

🔐 File Encryption & Decryption System
📜 Project Overview
This project is a console-based Java application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) or RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) algorithms. It ensures secure data storage and transfer, making it highly useful for businesses and personal data protection.

📌 Features
✔ Encrypt any file (text, images, PDFs, etc.) using AES or RSA.
✔ Decrypt files back to their original state.
✔ Generate and store encryption keys securely.
✔ User-friendly console interface for easy interaction.
✔ Error handling and logging for better usability.
